<div style="padding:0px 20px;margin-top: 10px;margin-left: 20px;margin-right: 20px; font-weight: bold;color: rgb(218, 71, 71); background-color:rgb(255, 255, 255) ;overflow-y: auto; max-height: calc(100vh - 175px);"><br>1. The team that starts the game will be decided by Coin Toss.<br>
    2. Each team or player is assigned a colour, which will be the colour first pocketed by the team. They can only pocket that colour carrom men going forward 
   <br> 3. Pocketing the queen must be followed by pocketing another coin (of the team's colour) on the same strike.
   <br>  4. The queen can only be pocketed if the player has already pocketed a carrom man but has not yet pocketed the last carrom man of the player's colour as a carrom man must be pocketed to cover it.
   <br>  5. Once the queen is covered, whoever clears all their carrom men first wins the board.
   <br>  6. The winner of a board collects one point for each of the opponent's carrom men left at the finish and three points for the queen if covered by the winner 
   <br>  7. When placing the striker on the board to shoot, it must touch both baselines, either covering the end circle completely or not touching it at all. The striker may not touch the diagonal arrow line.
   <br>  8. Shooting styles can vary between players, but all shots must involve flicking the striker and not pushing it. While players may orient their bodies for aiming, they must remain seated for the shot.
   <br>  9. Carrom men can be struck directly only if they are not touching the player's baseline or situated behind the baseline. 
   <br>  10. Sinking the striker incurs a penalty of one piece and a loss of turn. If a piece is pocketed in the same shot as the striker that piece is also removed. These pieces are returned to the board in the centre circle. If the striker is sunk before any of a player's carrom men, that player must later return a carrom man after sinking to make up for the deficit.
   <br>  11. If while the queen and a carrom man are sunk on the same shot, the queen is considered covered regardless of the order that the pieces entered the pocket.
   <br>  12. If a piece jumps off the board, it is placed on the centre spot. If pieces land on end or are overlapping, they are left that way.
   <br>  13. If the centre spot is partially covered when replacing the queen or a jumped piece, the piece should cover as much red as possible. If totally covered, the piece is placed opposite the next player behind the red spot.
   <br>  14.One can touch any coin. However, if the player touches their last piece directly before the queen, penalty will be imposed.
   <br>  15. If a player sinks an opponent's piece, that player loses a turn. If a player sinks an opponent's last carrom piece they lose the board and three points are deducted from their score.
   <br>  16. If a player sinks their last piece before the queen, they lose the board, three points and one point for each of their opponent's pieces left.
